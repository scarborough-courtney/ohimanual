###Example assessments, study areas and regions

The ‘study area’ (entire area included in the assessment) and ‘regions’ (subunits at which calculations are conducted) are defined based on the scale of how available data are reported and the scale of management decisions. Studies conducted with study areas smaller than the global assessment are considered ‘regional assessments’. Note that, while each goal score is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, during the calculation process, data layers are expressed on a scale from 0 to 1 and later multiplied by 100 (for convenience). As a result, when referring to individual dimensions or data layers, we discuss data on a scale from 0-1 units.

Below are four assessments conducted that provide examples of decisions made in order to use the best available data to capture the philosophy of the Ocean Health Index.

###**Global 2012:**

Description: This is the first assessment, launched in 2012 and published in the scientific journal Nature (Halpern et al. 2012).

Study area: Global.

Regions: 171 exclusive economic zones (EEZs) or island groupings. All waters within 200 nautical miles from the coastline were assessed. These regions mainly coincided with EEZ boundaries, but in some cases, combined information across multiple smaller areas and/or offshore territorial holdings were used when available data were particularly sparse.


###**Global 2013:**

Description: This assessment, conducted in 2013 at the global scale, updates and improves upon Global 2012.

Study area: Global.

Regions: 220 exclusive economic zones (EEZs) and territories. The additional 50 reporting regions included in the 2013 assessment are largely the result of disaggregating the island groupings that had been combined in the 2012 assessment, and in one case because a new region, Brunei, and its EEZ were being recognized. (Here and elsewhere the OHI does not include disputed waters in its analysis, and expresses no position or opinion on ownership of any disputed waters). Reporting these regions separately preserves higher resolution information whenever possible. If higher resolution information was not available, we gap-filled by applying coarser resolution information across all smaller regions, distributing the values with one of a variety of approaches, to allow calculation of Index scores for as many regions as possible.

###**Brazil:**

Description: This first regional assessment was published in 2014 in the scientific journal PLoS ONE (Elfes et al. 2014).

Study area: Brazil.

Regions: 17 coastal states of Brazil.

###**US West Coast:**

Description: This is a data-rich example conducted at a smaller scale: the US West Coast.
Study area: US West Coast.

Region: five coastal regions within the US West Coast: Oregon, Washington, Northern California, Central California, and Southern California. California’s large geographical extent and diversity (ecological, social, economic, etc) justified division into three regions; we used county boundaries closely aligned with biogeographic boundaries creating natural break points.
