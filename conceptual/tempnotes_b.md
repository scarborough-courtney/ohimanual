## Resilience

### How to get started

Key questions:<!---with the key questions formatted like this it makes me think that the headings in the document will correspond with the titles of these questions, and I think that might actually be a good idea. What do you think? I think having this document actually mirror what is laid out in these questions would really help with comprehension. I would either change around the narrative to better reflect these key questions, or change the key questions to reflect what the most important things are about this document. I would also put the "key questions" from the bottom of this document up front too because I feel like these really get to the heart of how to conceptualize resilience in the OHI context--->
* What is resilience?
* What types of data can be used? <!---could be added to reflect the current layout--->
* What are the ideal data?
* How do I find data for resilience?
* What are some resources I can use?
* Where can I get started?

#### What is resilience?
<!---short description here of what resilience is and what this document is meant to clarify about resilience--->
<!---This could also be where you first bring up the 3 different parts of resilience measures that are now at the very bottom of this document--->

#### Local to Global: Regulations at Different Scales

Environmental regulation exists at many spatial scales. From the local, to the regional, to the global scales, there are different ways society manages its natural resources, engages in trade, and protects its environment. This makes finding information about regulations an opportunity and a challenge. It is an opportunity because there is a wealth of information available to use, but it is also a challenge because the quality of the information, and its relevance in the context of OHI, is not guaranteed.

'Global datasets' refer to datasets where information is reported for each country, and such datasets offer broad insight for comparison between countries. However, they are the coarsest types of data for you regional assessment. You can't compare specific regions within your assessment area using global data because all regions will have the same value or score from the global database, unless that one value is transformed somehow, for instance by multiplying it with more local population data, in order to be an indirect way to make a measurement. Some reputable global database examples are the World Bank data, World Governance Indicators, World Development Indicators, and any dataset maintained by a United Nations or other inter-governmental organization; these include datasets from UN FAO, UNESCO, JMP/UNICEF, and composite information provided by the Human Development Index, for example.

> The wealth of international data is growing. For instance, the Millennium Development Goals (MGDs) have inspired much data-collection, such as the UNICEF/JMP's water and sanitation metrics. This is where Global Assessments get their "access to sanitation" metric to assess water cleanliness and ecological pressures. It's also a dataset used in other global composite index assessments. Note that the MDGs are expiring in 2015, soon to be replaced by the Sustainable Development Goals, which should bring more traction to international environmental monitoring and metrics. In future assessments, new and better datasets for particular aspects of ocean health and human well-being may become available.

When available, National-level data are preferable to global-level data for your assessment. These include national laws on the environment, or protection of the marine environment or rivers that lead to coastal waters. National laws include things like the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in the U.S., or the national implementations of the E.U. Water Framework Directive. National actions can also be broadened beyond just legislation to include administrative procedures such as those involving permits, licenses, court cases, administrative action, and compliance mechanisms. [Cultural items at the national scale, such as holidays, are also applied at this scale]

State or province-level laws provide more regionally-specific information and thus work well for assessments. This would involve looking at the same types of laws and policies that exist on the national level, but specifically incorporating those that have been tailored to fit the needs of a particular sub-national area. This includes things such as California's state-level California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), or the California Ocean Protection Act (COPA), which have laws designed specifically to protect California's environment. This would tell you more relevant information than using data from a national or international law. Local level regulations will usually provide you with the most accurate information for your assessment in order to tailor it best to the local context.

#### Scoring: Turning Qualitative into Quantitative
<!---I would be more exlicit up front about what the 3 different types of resilience measures are here. Step through the 3 kinds and how each gradually incorporates more information making for a richer resilience measure-->
There are several ways to turn the qualitative information of regulations and social actions into quantitative metrics for analysis. A  robust way is to give credit for different aspects of the resilience measures. In addition to a score for having the law, policy, or action, in place, it is possible to gauge the effectiveness of that activity.

The simplest way is to give credit for having a resilience measure in place. This means assigning a binary score of zero or one for "presence" versus "absence" of the resilience measure. For international conventions, this can be done by assigning a value of 1 for having signed a convention. A more rigorous score can be given for countries that have further *ratified* a convention in addition to signing it; this is one way to further differentiate scores. 

> For example, if you were trying to find out if there are regulations in place that guide fishing pressure, you could look to see if regulations exist for trawl-fishing limitations, or see if there are regulations for fish size or length, or if there are any seasonal restrictions. Another option would be to see if formal stock assessments exist for commercially-fished species.

A further step is to assess how well those measures are being complied with. This will give you a more robust way to assess how well a resilience mechanism is working to accomplish the goals of the regulation and thereby enhance ecosystem health.

> For example, once you have found out whether regulations for fishing pressure exist, you would then try to find measured values of compliance with these regulations. These could be raw data or calculated statistics such as rate of compliance or proportion of compliance. It should answer the question, "Are there indicators of compliance with fishing pressure guidelines"?

A subsequent, and final, step to creating a robust resilience assessment is to determine whether there are enforcement mechanisms in place to deal with non-compliance with the regulations. This is because a regulation is only as good as its implementation, and having both enforcement and compliance actions in place would reinforce the regulation and make it more effective.

> For example, in the case of fishing pressures, a further look into available data could lead you learn whether there are reported values of inspector or enforcement coverage of fishing vessels. Or you could look at reported numbers of enforcement actions in response to non-compliance. Further, you could also see if there are fines that have been paid or exist in association with non-compliance.

#### Data sources: Typology of Laws, Policies, Regulations

<!---Link to Courtney's Google Doc-->

Environmental laws and policies offer tangible information on resilience. The most common type of environmental regulations come from administrative law, such as pollution regulation of various kinds. Land-use law is also important to the integration of social and ecosystem issues, so finding zoning laws relevant for coastal areas could be useful, and so could finding whether or not a region requires environmental impact statements before allowing construction for either coastal land or for marine planning. Other kinds of law include court cases settling disputes or requiring reparation of pollution damages, for example.

Resilience also goes beyond just the law, however. Insurance policies present another option, for instance. Coastal areas are increasingly requiring climate-related insurance in some countries, and so the existence of such markets in a vulnerable area would be an example of a climate change resilience measure. Social initiatives also present another way to tackle resilience. There might be a beach clean-up day, a percentage of the refuse material that is recycled by the population, or some other social factor that reduces trash inputs into the ocean. A local law banning plastic bags is another way that local jurisdictions control plastic trash.

> For example in the Brazil study (2014), the marine trash resilience was calculated by counting up whether localities had one of four garbage management services, including access to beach clean-up services, household garbage collection, household recycling collection, and garbage collection in public streets. <!---Julie's MS--->

#### **Examples of Resilience Metrics**

#### Case Study: High Seas Assessment (2014)

#### Case Study Comparison: Israel (2014) and US West Coast (2014) <!---This Israel section doesn't really make sense to me, what are we trying to accomplish by calling out this example? I think just listing the names of the resilience layers as we have been calling them doesn't really help explain resilience, so I would maybe cut this section. Or combine this with the US West Coast example to focus more on the difference between the two. I would focus on highlighting where each differed from the global assessment, maybe in a table format to highlight that there were very few (if any) changes for the Israel assessment and quite a few for US West Coast--->

The Israel assessment used mostly the same resilience layers as the Global Study (Halpern 2013) <!---Julie, is this true?--->. This means that resilience measures were only provided at the scale of the entire country and there was no opportunity to differentiate between sub-regions <!---should this be a different word?---> within Israel to more accurately assess local patterns of resilience. In contrast the U.S. West Coast assessment (2014) used a tailor-made set of resilience metrics. These were more informative than the global metrics in that they reflected the policy response to the local context and allowed for sub-regions within the study to recieve different scores depending on their individual performance. <!---The Marine Mammal Protection Act was not used in the US West Coast study so I removed that--->

#### Key Questions
<!---from Julie's MS--->
<!---I would reformat this to ask these questions at the very beginning of the document and then change the format of the rest of the narrative to follow this flow.--->
What laws or regulations are in place that would mitigate pressures?
<!---From Courtney's GoogleDoc--->

1. Does a regulation exist that appropriately addresses a specific pressure?
   * Assign a score of 0 or 1
2. Is the regulation being appropriately complied with?
    * For instance, the CBD surveys will tell you this kind of information. So will various "scorecards" or compliance assessments by interested third parties (e.g., Transparency International's Corruption Index)
3. Are there mechanisms in place supporting enforcement of the regulations?
    * e.g., CITES convention has a clause that causes parties to restrict trade with countries that are not complying with the convention
