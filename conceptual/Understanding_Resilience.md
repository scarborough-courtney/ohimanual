##**Understanding Resilience**

A resilience measure can be a law, policy, or a given performance evaluation that speaks to the effectiveness of actions to improve ocean health.

*Ultimately, it is resilience that will help determine the future of ocean health.*

Resilience actions are the best way to improve a score for a country, because they can reduce pressures, protect ocean habitats and species, improve status, and optimize benefits to people.

There are different categories of resilience, from institutional, to social, to ecological.

For each goal the Index measures several aspects of resilience: (1) ecological integrity is evaluated as the relative condition of assessed species in a given location and goal-specific regulations including laws and other institutional measures  that address ecological pressures.  (2) Social integrity describes the internal processes of a community that affect its resilience.  

Resilience is calculated as the sum of the ecological factors and social initiatives (policies, laws, indicators of good governance, etc.) that can positively affect goal scores by reducing or eliminating pressures. This is because resilience in the Index framework acts to reduce pressures in each region. Therefore, resilience measures must not only be directly or indirectly relevant to ocean health, but must be in response to a pressure layer affecting a goal.

Social integrity differs among nations.  A nation’s successes or deficiencies affect both its own population and those of other nations, so projects have evolved to evaluate social aspects of resilience.  The Ocean Health Index assesses social integrity wit information from the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI). WGI evaluates how well governments exercise powers to benefit citizens and, indirectly environmental quality by assessing freedom of expression and citizens’ ability to select their government; political stability; absence of violence and terrorism; government effectiveness; quality of regulations; extent to which the rule of law prevails; and extent of corruption

The Index also uses other composite measures of resilience for particular goals, including the Travel and Tourism Competitive Index and the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) that evaluates a country’s competitiveness in achieving sustained economic prosperity.

A WGI score of 1 means that social integrity is the best it can be; and a score of 0 means that governance is completely ineffective, so that the country has no social Resilience.  The full composite score for all six WGI indicators is used to evaluate social resilience for all of the Ocean Health Index goals except for Livelihoods; the Livelihoods goal only uses the WGI’s Regulatory Quality data layer, because it also uses the Global Competitiveness Index, which duplicates, but improves, the remaining WGI layers for this purpose.

Although resilience really should be judged by the effectiveness of its outcome, this is not possible at the global level.  Therefore nations are given advanced credit for signing treaties, e.g. for conserving biodiversity or eliminating trade in endangered species, and for measures of social integrity.  The assumption is that results from those beneficial actions and conditions will become visible in following years as increased scores for goal status and trend

Coral reef organisms have very limited resilience to human-caused pressures.  Some individuals and species may tolerate environmental insults better than others, but no natural resilience can reduce such pressures.  Protective actions taken by people are a reef’s only ultimate source of resilience.  Humans don’t usually take such actions just to preserve a reef for its existence value, but also to safeguard the its flow of benefits to people, including food, ornamental fishes for aquariums, medical products, tourism and others.  So from the human perspective, preserving coral reefs is an expression of resilience.

As nation states arose, laws and regulations have steadily evolved to meet their needs.

Physical manifestations of resilience also appeared, such as public works projects for worship, defense, transportation, water, sanitation and many others.

The UN’s main goal was to prevent another world war, but over time it has become the nucleus for international and planetary resilience through programs in peace and security, development, human rights, humanitarian affairs and international law.

he UN also organizes treaties such as the  Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and programs such as the Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals that aim to end poverty and hunger, build healthy lives and well-being, achieve gender equality and empower women and girls; ensure access to sustainable sources of water, sanitation, energy; reduce inequality; combat climate change; create safe and resilient cities and settlements; and use ocean and land sustainably.  Though such engagements are entirely voluntary, most countries participate, and the Ocean Health Index considers such participation in calculating resilience scores.  

####Ideal Approach

Ideally, assessments of social resilience would include national-level and as well as local rules and other relevant institutional mechanisms that are meant to safeguard ocean health. The global focus has been on international treaties and indices, so your region should have more localized information. There would also be information as to their effectiveness and enforcement. of more. Information on social norms and community (and other local-scale) institutions (such as tenure or use rights) that influence resource use and management would be useful too.
