##**Understanding Status**

The status component of each goal is captured through a model that represents the philosophy of the goal in a way that produces findings that are most useful to inform decision-making at the scale of your assessment.

The current status of each goal is determined by comparing the most recent measure of the goal with a goal-specific sustainable reference point. For each goal, as well as for many individual data layers, values are rescaled to reference points, or targets, which serve as benchmarks based on SMART principles: Specific (to the management goal), Measurable, Ambition, Realistic, and Time-bound (Samhouri *et al.* 2012; Perrings *et al.* 2010; 2011).
