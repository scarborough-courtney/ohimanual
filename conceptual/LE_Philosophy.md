## **Coastal Livelihoods and Economies**

> The **Coastal Livelihoods and Economies** goal rewards productive coastal economies that avoid the loss of ocean-dependent livelihoods while maximizing livelihood quality.

This goal is founded on two sub-goals, **Livelihoods** and **Economies**. **Livelihoods** is comprised of jobs and wages, and **Economies** is comprised of revenues. The two halves of this goal are tracked separately because the number and quality of jobs and the amount of revenue produced are both of considerable interest to stakeholders and governments, and could show very different patterns, such as is the case when high revenue sectors do not necessarily provide large employment opportunities. The goal aims to maintain the number of coastal and ocean-dependent livelihoods (jobs) in a region, and maintain productive coastal economies (revenues), while also maximizing livelihood quality (represented by relative wages).

> This is an area where economic studies are integrated and inform the concept of ocean health.

#### Keep in Mind

Maintaining jobs in this case means not losing jobs--this sub-goal does not give credit for *gaining* jobs in the Global Assessments. It does not attempt to capture aspects of job identity like reputation, desirability, or other social or cultural perspectives associated with different jobs, nor does it account for the impact upon an individual but rather focuses on the aggregate. One can examine the component parts that make up this goal, however, to evaluate individual sectors and infer implications for job identity.

### **Livelihoods**

> The **Livelihoods** sub-goal describes livelihood quantity and quality.

#### Philosophy

This sub-goal evaluates the quantitative and qualitative benefits workers get from the oceans in the form of jobs and wages. In the Global Assessments, the two sub-components are equally important because the number of jobs is a proxy for livelihood quantity, and the per capita average annual wages is a proxy for job quality. Some relevant sectors include tourism, commercial fishing, marine mammal watching, and working at ports and harbors, among others. Jobs and wages produced from marine-related industries are clearly of huge value to many people, and directly benefit those who are employed--they also benefit those who do not directly participate in the industries but rather gain indirectly from the value of community identity, tax revenues, and other indirect economic and social impacts of a stable coastal economy.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, this goal would represent and encompass all marine sectors that supply jobs and wages to coastal communities, incorporating information on the sustainability of different sectors and also working conditions and job satisfaction. Job identity would also be an important part of this. Capturing the indirect as well as direct benefits from jobs, wages and revenue from coastal communities and beyond is best; where data do not exist, multipliers derived from the literature can be incorporated into jobs to attempt to capture this. The reference point in this sub-goal will likely be set as a moving window temporal approach, or a spatial comparison.

#### Keep in Mind

It's important to note that the data approaches taken to date in the Global Assessments are imperfect, and do not represent the one way to convey the importance of individual identity with coastal work. The values are shown for the aggregate community and are proxies for quality-of-life of the individual. In further assessments, any new data that may otherwise speak to well-being would represent a useful improvement.

#### History of the Approach

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | This sub-goal is measured as the number of direct and indirect jobs across sectors within a region plus the average purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted wages within each sector. Jobs are summed across sectors and measured at current and reference time points. Wages are averaged across sectors within each region and the reference value is taken from the region with the highest average wages across all sectors.<br  /><br  />In the livelihoods sub-goal, jobs had a moving target temporal comparison and wages had a spatial comparison. The reference point for jobs (and for the economies sub-goal) is a moving baseline because there is no established target for number of jobs (and setting a specific target number of jobs would be completely arbitrary). In these cases it is important to compare the same place to itself in the past, and not to compare it to a different place. Therefore, the objective of the jobs component is actually no loss of jobs. In addition, we want to ensure that we are detecting changes that are specific to marine-related sectors. Jobs must keep pace with growth in employment rates or sustain losses no greater than national increases in unemployment rates. For wages we assumed the target value for average annual wages is the highest value observed across all reporting units. | We assumed that sector-specific job and revenue multipliers are static and globally consistent, but distinct for developed versus developing regions (when such information was available), because we do not have data to resolve temporal or regional differences. For all other sectors where the data sources only provided direct jobs or direct revenue, we used sector- and development status-specific multipliers derived from the literature to estimate total job or revenue impacts. We did not apply multiplier values to wages since the cascading effects of earned income are more contentious. To account for broader economic forces that may affect jobs independent of changes in ocean health (e.g., a global recession), we adjusted (as noted above) relative values for the number of jobs by changes in national employment rates.<br  /><br  />While job identity has social and cultural value, there are not adequate data to track individual workers and assess their job satisfaction on a global scale. Also because of data constraints, this goal does not provide more credit for sectors or economic activities that are more ecologically sustainable. | A score of 100 would indicate that the number of marine jobs had not reduced relative to that number five years previous, and that the wages in the area were the highest anywhere.
**Global 2013** | Based on Global 2012, with some simplifications: Since many of the values were not available in 2010, older wages data were divided by the inflation conversion factor for 2010 so that wage data across years would be comparable in 2010 US dollars. These data were also multiplied by the purchasing power parity-adjusted per capita GDP (PPPpcGDP). Jobs data were adjusted by dividing by total number of people employed for the corresponding year: (1 – percent unemployment) * total labor force. This factor ensures that any changes detected are strictly due to marine-related dynamics and not driven by national macroeconomic events across all sectors, marine and not. One of the adjustment terms previously used was considered redundant and removed: an additional factor had previously been used to modify the wages data, obtained from the International Labour Organization (ILO).<br  /><br  />The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012 except for a few simplified multipliers. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012. |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | This goal follows the same model as in Global 2012, but using local data with a slightly different list of sectors. Data came from the National Ocean Economics Program (NOEP); sectors include: living resources, tourism and recreation, shipping and transport, marine related construction, and ship and boat building/repair. For each of these sub-components we use sector-specific multipliers derived from the NOEP data so that we assess both direct and indirect effects. We recognize that sectors and economic activity within a region can be influenced by activities outside the region (e.g., fish caught in Alaska could be brought to Washington for processing, or vice-versa), thus leading to an over or under estimate economic benefits derived from marine ecosystems within the study region. As with any ecosystem study, defining boundaries for the ecosystem is an artificial operation, and linkages with external elements necessarily exist but are challenging to account for.<br  /><br  />The reference point was the same as in Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012. |

### **Economies**

> The **Economies** sub-goal captures the economic value associated with marine industries using revenue from marine sectors.

#### Philosophy

The **Economies** sub-goal evaluates the revenue generated from marine-based industries. Strong coastal economies are something that people value, and this can be reflected by the GDP generated by these coastal regions both directly and indirectly. The economies sub-goal is composed of a single component, revenue.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, economic data would be collected for each coast, and traced from sectors both directly and indirectly related to marine industries. When these data are not available it is possible to use revenue data at a larger scale and adapt them to a coastal area based on population distribution. The reference point in this sub-goal will likely be set as a moving-window temporal approach.

#### Keep in Mind

The definition of a marine-related sector can vary. There are jobs that are directly connected to the marine environment, such as shipping, fishing, longshore workers, but also some that are connected indirectly, such as supplies and supporting industries. The use of multipliers in attempts to capture the indirect revenue generated by jobs more indirectly associated to marine sectors is a well-established method in economics, and is encouraged in this approach.

#### History of the Approach

Assessment | Model Description and Reference Point | Evolution of Approach | Interpreting a score
---------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
**Global 2012** | This sub-goal is captured as the total adjusted revenue generated directly and indirectly from each sector (measured in 2010 USD), at current and reference time points.<br  /><br  />In the economies sub-goal, revenue had a moving target temporal comparison. Because there is no absolute reference point for revenue, this sub-goal employs a moving baseline. We made a correction to revenue based on a region's GDP (“no loss and must keep pace with growth in GDP or can sustain losses comparable to national declines in GDP”). The current and reference years used for unemployment and GDP data were based on the average current year and average reference year across the sector data sources used for number of jobs and revenue, respectively. | We assumed that sector-specific job and revenue multipliers are static and globally consistent, but distinct for developed versus developing regions (when such information was available), because we do not have data to resolve temporal or regional differences. For all other sectors where the data sources only provided direct jobs or direct revenue, we used sector- and development status-specific multipliers derived from the literature to estimate total job or revenue impacts. We did not apply multiplier values to wages since the cascading effects of earned income are more contentious. | A score of 100 would indicate that revenue has not decreased compared to its value five years previous.
**Global 2013** | The model was same as Global 2012, with a few simplifications:  revenue data were adjusted by dividing by GDP per region (reported in 2013 USD; data from the World Bank).<br  /><br  />The reference point was the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012, although simplified where appropriate. |
**Brazil (2014)** | The model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012. |
**U.S. West Coast (2014)** | The model and reference point were the same as Global 2012. | The approach was the same as Global 2012. |
