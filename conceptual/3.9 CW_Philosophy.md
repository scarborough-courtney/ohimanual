**Clean Waters**

This goal captures the degree to which waters are polluted by natural and man-made causes.

People enjoy the presence of unpolluted estuarine, coastal, and marine waters for their aesthetic value and because they help avoid detrimental health effects to people or the marine life on which they depend. Many things can be responsible for negatively affecting clean waters, including sewage pollution (fecal coliform, viruses, parasites), nutrient runoff (eutrophication, algal blooms), chemical pollution (oil spills), and marine debris (floating trash). Combining the scores for these pollutants with a geometric mean ensures that just one of the pollutants can drive the model, with the philosophy that if one of the pollutants is greatly impacting the system, how the others are affecting the system is less critical because there is already great impact.

Ideally, data would be available and combined from many different categories of marine pollution to best capture the factors that can cause waters to become unsuitable for recreation or other purposes. The type of reference point used will depend on the data available; a functional relationship would be best for setting limits to uses.
