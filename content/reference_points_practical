###Reference Points
###Practical Considerations

*****

One approach: other countries have used the minimum need of fish protein for a model to see if the demand is meeting that. China-specific model: need to discuss with fishery management agencies.

Lesson: talk to agencies in goal-model development.

#### Case Study: China

As an example of when you would set a reference point, target, the China team compares the reference point for fisheries with the targets set by the 13th five year China state plan.

Setting reference points depends on the goal philosophy and the available data. For instance, a sustainable seafood management goal could be measured in terms of yields if the goal is focused on maximizing food provision or in number of jobs if the goal is focused on maximizing social and economic welfare. These two goal framings would lead to the development of different targets in terms of both yields and level of employment. Where necessary, our conceptual framework encourages the reframing of management goals to ensure that the corresponding indicators, and the units in which they are reported, accurately portray the intent of the goal.

It is important to understand that setting a reference point is a choice. This choice can be informed by the literature and by expert advice, and can be discussed in terms of costs and benefits. However, ultimately there may be no optimum and certainly not only one approach, and therefore setting a reference point can be very uncomfortable, but even more important to define explicitly.

Samhouri *et al.* (2012) developed a set of decision trees that provide guidance for choosing among three types of target reference points, using SMART principles for target setting: Specific (to the management goal), Measurable, Ambitious, Realistic, and Time-bound. Please refer to this Samhouri *et al.* (2012) for detailed information about these three approaches. Briefly, these authors describe targets that compare the current ecosystem state with its ideal state using three approaches:

1.	functional relationship with environmental conditions
2.	time series approaches that compare current to previous capacities to obtain a particular ocean state in a specific location
3.	spatial reference points that compare current capacities to achieve a desired ocean state across regional (or, if necessary, global) scales

We refer to these three approaches as those based on functional relationships, time series approaches, and spatial comparisons. Note that all three types of targets require that:

* the management goal is articulated precisely so that the appropriate indicator and indicator units are used and societal preferences are accurately represented
* scientific understanding about the relationship between the ecosystem state and natural or human pressures is reviewed
* data sources and their limitations are investigated thoroughly

#### Functional relationships

This type of target is derived from a known relationship (an equation) between the ocean indicator and a natural or human pressure. If an empirical or theoretical functional relationship is available, it can be used to determine a reference point for the amount of a benefit that can be expected from the system. This process is simplified because functional relationships are often associated with thresholds and reflection points.

The wild-caught fisheries sub-goal of food provision uses a functional relationship to determine the reference point.

#### Time series approaches

In cases where a functional relationship is unavailable, it is possible to use time series data to evaluate the current ocean conditions in an individual location relative to conditions in that location at a previous time period. Time series data are used to provide an internal standard against which current conditions are judged. We emphasize two types of targets that use time series data. The first is a baseline, which focuses on a stationary time period, relays information about what was previously possible in a particular location, and is especially useful for goals in which the desired state occurred at a fixed time in the past. The second is based on a moving window time period, which facilitates comparisons with contemporary conditions and smoothes short-term fluctuations and distortions in time series data. Moving window approaches are particularly appropriate when the intent of a management goal is to prevent declines in the current state relative to a recent time period. They are commonly used to describe the condition of financial markets (example: day-to-day changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average).

The **Carbon Storage** and **Coastal Protection** goals use time series approaches to determine reference points.

#### Spatial comparisons

Another approach to setting targets in cases where functional relationships are unavailable relies on spatial comparisons. Targets derived from spatial comparisons gauge the current ocean conditions in a particular location relative to the current ocean conditions in a reference area(s). In spatial comparisons, different locations are assumed to be capable of producing similar ecosystem benefits. In this case, the maximum amount of benefit observed across all locations is defined as the reference point and is used to judge the status in other locations. Thus, a target based on a spatial comparison relies on an external standard for all but one location (the place with the maximum benefit), under the assumption that if a reference location can attain a certain state, then so can other locations within the study area.

The **Economies** sub-goal use spatial comparisons to determine the reference point.

> In the U.S. West Coast study (2014), the approach to reference points was different from the Global approach. The values for **Tourism and Recreation** for regions within California, Washington, and Oregon were compared to themselves rather than held to the same standard across geographies. This way, scores reflected local conditions.

###How to set reference points?

There is no single way to set reference points. This ultimately will be an informed choice made by the team conducting the assessment. However, whatever discomfort there may be in setting reference points, it is essential to have such explicit targets to which current state of a goal is compared. Reference points are specific to a goal and in some cases to a data layer.

The process of determining reference points is both scientific and socio-political (Samhouri et al. 2012).  Science can provide information on thresholds or sustainable limits of delivering a goal, but often we do not know enough about such limits, and regardless, setting of reference points is always ultimately a social and political choice. Two examples can help illustrate this process.
* Decades of fisheries research has provided a wealth of information about how to set sustainable harvest levels, yet uncertainties, measurement error, and different levels of risk tolerance by policy makers and/or stakeholders leads to different specific reference points. For mariculture, we know that appropriate reference points are both a function of sustainable production densities (an active area of research) and total amount of coastal area available for mariculture (almost entirely a social decision).
* For habitat based goals (such as carbon storage and coastal protection), setting reference points requires information on past extent of habitats (which is often poorly known) and social decisions about how much habitat restoration is feasible and/or desired.
* For species based goals (iconic species and species biodiversity), science provides a wealth of information about how to assess the viability of individual species, but it is ultimately a social decision about weather reference points should be set at pristine conditions, impacted but sustainable populations, or even to allow some level of threat or loss to species.

In the goal descriptions below we provide details on how and why each reference point was selected.  This transparency allows decision makers who may be interested in using the Index to evaluate if they agree with the reference points or would instead choose to change them.

There is tension inherent to setting a target that is both ambitious and realistic.

Below is more information regarding the guidelines provided by Samhouri et al (2012). As stated, note that all three types of targets require that (a) the management goal is articulated precisely so that the appropriate indicator, and indicator currency, is used and societal preferences are accurately represented; (b) scientific understanding about the relationship between the ecosystem state and natural or human pressures is reviewed; and, (c) data sources and their limitations are investigated thoroughly.

####Functional Relationships

To derive an appropriate target level for an indicator of ocean conditions from a functional relationship, one should first test for linearity. A linear function does not directly suggest a reference point, but still can be used to set a target if there are established legal regulations or social norms (common standards of practice) associated with the relationship. For example, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency policy sets a threshold for the acceptable number of illnesses due to swimming and uses a linear functional relationship between swimming health safety and the concentration of Enterococcus bacteria to establish the bacterial concentration at which that limit reference point occurs. They base their recommendation for a target level of water quality for marine recreation on that limit. If a linear functional relationship is identified, but there is no legal or social standard to justify a specific target, a science-based, stakeholder-driven process can be used to identify an acceptable target. For example, if the relationship between marine reserve size and proportion of a fish population protected from fishing is assumed to be linear, a process of negotiation among fishermen, conservationists, and other interested parties can be used to determine appropriate guidelines for reserve size or total area designated for protection.

A nonlinear functional relationship can be used to set a target based on an optimum level or an established threshold. Optima and thresholds can be used directly, or with modifications such as precautionary buffers. For example, surplus production and yield-per-recruit models agree in a qualitative sense that fisheries yield should peak at an intermediate level of fishing pressure. This maximum is frequently referred to as the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Under the U.S. Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996, MSY is defined as a limit reference point. It is reduced based upon ecological, economic, or social considerations to create a target harvest level referred to as optimum yield.

####Time-series approaches

Both baseline and moving window targets are challenged by the need to choose an appropriate reference time period, with what is appropriate being guided by SMART Specific, Measurable, Ambitious, Realistic, and Time-bound principles . For example, we would contend that a reference point of pre-human conditions is not realistic. Choosing a reference period can be made less arbitrary by (1) attempting to minimize the sensitivity of the status assessment to the selected time period; (2) capturing all of the information available in the time series by ensuring that periods of substantive change are included or by making the moving window of time equivalent to the entire length of the time series; and, (3) following existing precedents. However, even arbitrary choices about the appropriate reference period can be informative, and are used frequently in relation to socioeconomic indicators, advances in human medicine, and in other contexts. Such targets convey straightforward information about the extent to which ocean conditions have changed through time.

####Spatial comparisons

To estimate a target using a spatial comparison, the current state in each location within a study region is cataloged, the maximum observed benefit is defined as the target, and the status of the benefit in each location within the region is assessed relative to that target value. For example, food provision from the ocean comes not just from wild fisheries but also from mariculture. As with terrestrial agriculture, mariculture’s status can be measured in terms of the yield from cultured stocks in a particular place. However, there will not be empirical data on the maximum yield that can be achieved for a given species in all locations of interest. As an alternative, inferences about the health of a specific location’s mariculture industry can be made with reference to regional (per unit area) potential. Indeed, a similar approach has been used to estimate crop ‘‘yield gaps’’ in terrestrial agriculture, in the context of conservation planning for ecosystem services, and to compare fish stock status outside of marine protected areas to status within them.

####Choosing the right type of target

Targets (and limits) should be measured in the same units as the indicator, or empirical proxy chosen to measure the state of a management goal. If management goals are not stated in ways that can be measured with empirical data they are not useful because there is no way to measure progress towards goal achievement. Furthermore, the specifics of how a goal is framed direct attention to the appropriate currency for the indicator.

There is no simple rubric for choosing the right type of target. Our framework is underpinned by the idea that targets based on functional relationships are ideal, but given data constraints, time series approaches and spatial comparisons may be more appropriate. The intent of a management goal, scientific understanding, data availability, and the degree to which potential targets adhere to SMART principles will largely dictate which type is most appropriate.

We consider functional relationships the best approach for deriving targets because they provide direct insight into how pressures can be adjusted to achieve management goals and do not rely on comparisons with other places or previous conditions. In addition, functional relationships allow for rigorous comparisons of ocean conditions between locations at any one time or between time periods at any one location. Targets based on functional relationships are more likely than time series approaches and spatial comparisons to strike the right balance between ambitious and realistic. Ultimately, functional relationships are the underlying basis for any goal even if it is difficult to define or measure them.

Unfortunately, targets based on functional relationships require a mechanistic and quantitative understanding---as well as site-specific knowledge--- of how pressures influence ocean conditions, so they  cannot be developed in many places where data are limited. In other words, targets based on functional relationships may not always be measurable or time-bound, even if they are otherwise specific, ambitious, and realistic.  Thus in practice it is likely that the other types of targets will be used with greater frequency.

The choice between using a time series approach or spatial comparison to set a target can be made based on an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, the needs of the particular assessment, and the constraints of available data. This decision can be facilitated by evaluating both the quality of the available data (e.g., gaps in time series, poor spatial resolution or replication) and the type of target that is most informative of the progress towards the goal under consideration. Targets based on time series approaches and spatial comparisons do not require a mechanistic understanding of the system, although some knowledge about such relationships can help constrain the temporal or spatial comparisons. As such, they provide relative measures of ocean condition. For example, with targets based on a time series approach, two locations characterized by very different ocean conditions could be assessed with equivalent status if ocean conditions in both places changed by the same proportion over the reference period.

Similarly, a target based on a spatial comparison does not reveal whether the location with the maximum state during the observation period approximates the ideal state that a functional relationship would reveal. As for the case of linear functional relationships, both time series approaches and spatial comparisons require ancillary information in order to establish what is considered an ideal state. In the absence of such information, these types of comparisons may still be useful at least for tracking relative progress. Therefore, both approaches have utility as practical solutions to the problem of setting targets given the realities of current scientific understanding and data availability.

A target based on a time series has the advantage that it creates an internal standard against which ocean conditions in a location of interest are measured, i.e., it controls for all variables that are specific to a particular location. In that way, it provides a reasonable proxy for judging the potential of a site to obtain a particular state in the absence of a functional relationship. The choice between baseline and moving window targets, and the choice of a timeframe for each, depends on how the management goal is articulated.

* A baseline target is appropriate when a management goal is concerned with how much the ocean conditions have changed relative to a previous condition, and a fixed point in time is considered the best available proxy for the achievable potential of a site. However, a baseline target focused too far in the past may tend to be more ambitious than realistic.
* A moving window target is appropriate when a management goal is focused on contemporary management effectiveness and conditions in the immediate past provide relevant information about either the desired state or stability of conditions over the timeframe encompassed by the window. However, a moving window target may be more realistic than ambitious. Disadvantages of targets based on time series approaches include the need for site- or regional-specific time series data, the subjectivity involved with choosing an appropriate reference time period, and the need for knowledge about longer-period cycles (e.g., Pacific Decadal Oscillation) that can influence possible reference values.

There will be goals for which a similarly compelling case can be made for using a time series approach versus a spatial comparison. Because they rely on data for a single location at multiple times or for many places during a single snapshot in time, and such information will often be contained within a single data set, time series approaches and spatial comparisons can be used to create specific, measurable, realistic, and time-bound targets. Ultimately, the final choice of which to use may depend on whether the assessment process is more interested in tracking a location’s performance over time or in comparing assessment units (locations) to one another.
