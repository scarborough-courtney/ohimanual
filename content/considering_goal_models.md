## Considering goal models

There are different ways to work with local data that better describes what the goal aims to measure. When better data are available, it is possible to incorporate it into goal models in two ways:

* goal model does not change but underlying data better describe local conditions 
* goal model is modified to incorporate new information

It's best to start by discussing the characteristics in your local system, what kind of data you have, and then how you would adapt the model because of those better data. 

## Reference points

Setting reference points is a choice. If there is not a functional relationship, it is important to discuss the costs and benefit of setting reference points differently, but there is no optimum or right way. Makes it difficult, but important to define. 

## To begin your discussion

Here are questions to think about regarding goal models. 

* Which coastal habitats are in your study area?


Identify priorities.

Habitat-based goals: 

* Coastal Protection 
* Carbon Storage
* Habitats (sub-goal of Biodiversity).


## Quick reference

**Priorities for incorporating better data**:
 
Goal | Priority for modification | Details
-----|---------------------------|--------
coastal protection | high | local habitat data should be better than global data
carbon storage | high | local habitat data should be better than global data
habitats sub-goal | high | local habitat data should be better than global data
tourism & recreation | high | use local data to develop a refined goal model
natural products | low | identify whether local products are important to local context
species sub-goal | low | would require a lot of GIS to redo



### General advice on changing goal models

These are general thoughts but it is important to revisit them for the local context

Goal | Modify goal model? | Details
-----|---------------------|--------
food provision | no | should remain a weighted combination of wild-caught fisheries and mariculture 
wild-caught fisheries |  | 
mariculture | yes | reference point should be modified to the local context
artisanal fishing opportunity | yes | this model should be based on access: physical, economic, regulatory, and status of fish stocks
natural products | no | goal model doesn't need to change but local data are important
carbon storage | no | model should remain the area and quality of carbon-storing habitats
coastal protection | no | model should remain the area and quality of protective habitats, along with a protective ranking
livelihoods & economies | no | stay with the moving average reference point; improve with better local data. could also weigh these two subgoals unequally
tourism & recreation | yes | modify model and reference point based on best local data available: this goal takes some creativity to capture
lasting special places | yes | what defines special places in the local context? best to identify special places and then determine whether they are protected
iconic species | no | same approach, improved data
clean waters | no | could maintain geometric mean or use a weighted mean, but pollution categories should not be combined equally
species sub-goal | no | use same approach: all species, weighted by their habitat area
